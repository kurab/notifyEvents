# notifyEvents

Google App Script sample to post Google Calendar's events on Google Chat, Chatwork and LINE.

Required Accounts are:

Google and Chatwork doesn't need special permission. Normal user can use this script.

Chatwork function uses ChatWorkClient library.
Add a library: ```M6TcEyniCs1xb3sdXFF_FhI-MNonZQ_sT```

To use LINE function, you need to publish this script as web app.

Anyway, you can do everything on Google Drive.
